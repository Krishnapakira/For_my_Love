        <h1>My Love ❤️,</h1>
        <p>From the very first moment we met, you became the most beautiful part of my life. 🌸 Every day, every night, no matter how far we are, you are always in my heart 💕, my thoughts, and my dreams. I find myself looking at your pictures before I sleep 😴, not just because I miss you, but because seeing your face brings me peace—it reminds me that love this deep, this true, is worth every second of waiting. ⏳❤️</p>
        <p>Distance may separate us physically, but in every moment, my heart reaches for you. 💞 No matter the situation, no matter what we go through, I want you to know that I will always be here. In your happiest days, I will be by your side, celebrating every joy with you. 🎉 In your hardest times, I will hold you even tighter 🤗, reminding you that you are never alone. Even in the moments we disagree, my love for you never wavers—because no matter what, you are the one I choose, always. 💖</p>
        <p>I am doing everything I can to meet you soon because I cannot wait to hold you in my arms 🤗, to see your smile in person 😊, to feel the warmth of your hand in mine. 🤝 And when that moment comes, I don’t ever want to let go. Because, my love, I don’t just want a few stolen moments with you—I want forever. ♾️❤️</p>
        <p>So, here I am, with all my heart ❤️, all my love 💕, asking you one simple question: <strong>Will you be mine? 💍 Not just for now, not just for the next few years, but for a lifetime? 🥰</strong> Because you are my once-in-a-lifetime, my forever, my always. 💖</p>
        <p>I love you more than words can ever say, and I will love you for all the days of my life. 💞</p>
